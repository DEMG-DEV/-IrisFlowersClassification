# IrisFlowersClassification
Iris flowers dataset is one of the best data sets in classification literature. 
The classification of the iris flowers machine learning project is often referred to as the “Hello World” of machine learning. 
Furthermore, this dataset has numeric attributes and beginners need to figure out how to load and handle data. 
Also, the iris dataset is small which easily fits into the memory and does not require any special transformations or scaling, 
to begin with.  

Iris Dataset can be downloaded from UCI ML Repository - [Download Iris Flowers Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris).  

The goal of this machine learning project is to classify the flowers into among the three species — virginica, setosa, or versicolor based on length and width of petals and sepals.
